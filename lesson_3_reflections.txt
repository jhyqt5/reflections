When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration and sharing code with other people. Also the ability to access your code from anywhere. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It gives you full control of whats coming into your local repository, so you know exactly what you're pulling down.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks, clones, and branches are ways to add new changes without
affecting the existing version.  

Branches: new changes are added inthe same repository.  
Forking and cloning: copies  entire repository to a new location.  

Forking is cloning to Github.
Cloning is any location you have access, namely your computer.

Branching used add new changes to a repository with a tag to easily navigate to and from.
Clone repositories to work on it locally.
Fork repository to make changes but not modify original.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The ability to work and merge on projects offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git/Github, I would use google drive to collaborate with friends. For some things, drive might be a better solution, i.e. word documents. But for coding projects with lines and lines of code, git/github would be easiest.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When collaborating with a team coding several features, branching is probably best. If working with 2-3 people, its probably easier to just work in the master.
